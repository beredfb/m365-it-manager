# Scope
- Comprehensive unit and integration testing for all MVP features
- 80%+ code coverage requirement for backend
- Test fixtures and mock data for Graph API calls
- Automated testing in CI/CD pipeline

# Non-goals
- No manual testing as primary quality gate
- No E2E testing tools like Playwright/Cypress for MVP
- No performance testing infrastructure for MVP

# Standards
- Backend: pytest, 80%+ coverage aim.
- Frontend: vitest + RTL.
- CI fails on lint/test.
