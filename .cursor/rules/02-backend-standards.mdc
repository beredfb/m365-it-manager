# Scope
- FastAPI with Python 3.11+ for all backend services
- Microsoft Graph API integration via services/graph_client.py
- Azure AD authentication with bearer tokens
- Structured error handling (RFC7807 problem+json)
- Comprehensive unit and integration testing

# Non-goals
- No Flask, Django, or other Python web frameworks
- No direct database access from MVP (Graph API only)
- No custom authentication mechanisms beyond Azure AD
- No GraphQL or REST API alternatives for Graph calls

# Standards
- FastAPI routers in app/routers/*
- Auth: bearer; consider OBO if needed.
- Retries for Graph (429/5xx) with exp backoff.
- Return problem+json errors.
- Unit tests per router (happy & edge).
