# Scope
- Azure cloud infrastructure using Infrastructure as Code
- Bicep templates for resource provisioning
- Azure Key Vault for secrets management
- GitHub Actions for CI/CD pipelines

# Non-goals
- No on-premises deployment for MVP
- No multi-cloud support (Azure only)
- No Terraform or other IaC tools
- No container orchestration beyond App Service

# Infrastructure & DevOps Standards

- **IaC**: Use Bicep for defining Azure infrastructure.
- **Secrets**: All secrets must be stored in Azure Key Vault. No secrets in `.env` files in production.
- **CI/CD**: Workflows are defined in `.github/workflows/`.
- **Environment Variables**: All environment-specific configurations should be managed through environment variables.
